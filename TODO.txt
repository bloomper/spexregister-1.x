    - Implement edit
      - Tabs
        - Activities
          - Drag and drop?

  - http://github.com/jfiorato/growl4rails
  - Skip mail batch functionality?

- Reporting
  - http://github.com/gunark/jasperserver-client

- Advanced search

- A more fine grained permission scheme

  - FGV should only be able to administer memberships

- Require SSL?
  - http://github.com/iwarshak/ssl_requirement

- Tests
  - Replace fixtures with factories (Factory Girl)?
  - Functional
    - RSpec?
    - Cucumber?
    - etc

Medium-term
-----------

- Add cron job for asynchronous mail processing
  "script/runner 'MailQueue.process' -e production"

- Add cron job for updating years in SpexCategory and Membership

- Update documentation

- Help page

- Help page for administrators

- Merge recent changes from existing register

- Import existing spex posters using rake task

- Import existing spex category logos using rake task

- Using the correct admin email address?

Long-term
---------

- Use friendly_id?
  - http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/friendly_id

- Better modeling of revivals to avoid duplication
  - Kind of tricky since the relationship with a spexare must be with the year(s)

Problems
--------
