Medium-term
-----------

- Add cron job for asynchronous mail processing
  "script/runner 'MailQueue.process' -e production"

- Add cron job for updating years in Spex

- Update documentation

- Help page

- Help page for administrators

- Fix import script/program

- Import existing spex posters

Long-term
---------

- Flash messages sometimes stay one request too long

- Use friendly_id?
  - http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/friendly_id

- Better modeling of revivals
  - Kind of tricky since the relationship with a spexare must be with the year(s)

- If deleting all entities, the table will be empty, i.e. the "none exist" message is not shown

- Pagination is not updated when deleting
  - This is a consequence of using Ajax and is probably not easily fixed

Problems
--------

- Lockdown
  - http://stonean.lighthouseapp.com/projects/33317/tickets/30-error-in-functional-test
  - Lockdown fails when running 'rake db:migrate' (did not happen with 1.3.1)
