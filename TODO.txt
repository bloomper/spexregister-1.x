- Show spexare? JS?

- Change my profile

- Simple search
  - Controller
  - Search result

- Tests
  - Replace fixtures with factories (Factory Girl)?
  - Functional
    - RSpec?
    - Cucumber?
    - etc

Medium-term
-----------

- Update jQuery Fancybox JS library

- Fix according to these issues when released:
  - https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2501
  - https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2365

- Add cron job for asynchronous mail processing
  "script/runner 'MailQueue.process' -e production"

- Add cron job for updating years in SpexCategory and Membership

- Update documentation

- Help page

- Help page for administrators

- Merge recent changes from existing register

- Import existing spex posters using rake task

- Import existing spex category logos using rake task

- Using the correct admin email address?

Long-term
---------

- Use friendly_id?
  - http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/friendly_id

- Better modeling of revivals to avoid duplication
  - Kind of tricky since the relationship with a spexare must be with the year(s)

- A more fine grained permission scheme
  - For example, a directeur should only be able to administer his/her spex
  - FGV should only be able to administer memberships

Problems
--------
