Medium-term
-----------

- Add cron job for asynchronous mail processing
  "script/runner 'MailQueue.process' -e production"

- Add cron job for updating years in Spex

- Update documentation

- Help page

- Help page for administrators

- Merge recent changes from existing register

- Import existing spex posters using rake task

Long-term
---------

- Flash messages sometimes stay one request too long
  - This is due to inherited_resources not using flash.now and there does not seem to be any way to override

- Use friendly_id?
  - http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/friendly_id

- Better modeling of revivals to avoid duplication
  - Kind of tricky since the relationship with a spexare must be with the year(s)

- If deleting all entities, the table will be empty, i.e. the "none exist" message is not shown

- Pagination is not updated when deleting
  - This is a consequence of using Ajax and is probably not easily fixed

Problems
--------
