  - Allow find_by_* methods to accept an options hash, so rails associations don't blow up

2010-10-07
 - Add conditions to ActiveHash#all (Ryan Garver)
 - Add #cache_key to ActiveHash::Base (Tom Stuart)
 - Add banged dynamic finder support to ActiveHash::Base (Tom Stuart)

2010-09-16
 - Enum format now uses underscores instead of removing all characters
 - Removed test dependency on acts_as_fu

2010-05-26
 - Silence metaclass deprecation warnings in active support 2.3.8

2010-05-04
 - When calling ActiveFile::Base.reload do not actually perform the reload if nothing has been modified unless you call reload(true) to force (Michael Schubert)

 - When ActiveRecord model belongs_to an ActiveHash and the associated id is nil, returns nil instead of raising RecordNotFound (Jeremy Weiskotten)
 - Merged Nakajima's "add" alias for "create" - gotta save those ASCII characters :)

2010-03-01
  - Removed "extend"-related deprecations - they didn't play well with rails class loading

2010-01-18
  - Added stub for #destroyed? method, since Rails associations now depend on it

2009-12-19
  - Added ActiveHash::Enum (John Pignata)
  - Deprecated include ActiveHash::Associations in favor of extend ActiveHash::Associations
  - Fixed bug where you can't set nil to an association
  - Calling #belongs_to now creates the underlying field if it's not already there (belongs_to :city will create the :city_id field)

2009-12-10
  - Fixed a bug where belongs_to associations would raise an error instead of returning
    nil when the parent object didn't exist.
  - Added #[] and #[]= accessors for more ActiveRecord-esque-ness. (Pat Nakajima & Dave Yeu)

2009-12-01
  - Add marked_for_destruction? to be compatible with nested attributes (Brandon Keene)
  - Added second parameter to respond_to? and cleaned up specs (Brian Takita)
  - Find with an id that does not exist now raises a RecordNotFound exception to mimic ActiveRecord (Pat Nakajima)

2009-10-22
  - added setters to ActiveHash::Base for all fields
  - instantiating an ActiveHash object with a hash calls the setter methods on the object
  - boolean default values now work

2009-10-21
  - Removed auto-reloading of files based on mtime - maybe it will come back later
  - Made ActiveFile::Base.all a bit more sane

2009-10-13
  - added ActiveHash::Base.has_many, which works with ActiveRecord or ActiveHash classes (thanks to baldwindavid)
  - added ActiveHash::Base.belongs_to, which works with ActiveRecord or ActiveHash classes (thanks to baldwindavid)
  - added .delete_all method that clears the in-memory array
  - added support for Hash-style yaml (think, Rails fixtures)
  - added setter for parent object on belongs_to ( city = City.new; city.state = State.first; city.state_id == State.first.id )

2009-10-12
  - auto-assign fields after calling data= instead of after calling .all
  - remove require 'rubygems', so folks with non-gem setups can still use AH
  - added more specific activesupport dependency to ensure that metaclass is available
  - AH no longer calls to_i on ids.  If you pass in a string as an id, you'll get a string back
  - Fancy finders, such as find_all_by_id_and_name, will compare the to_s values of the fields, so you can pass in strings
  - You can now use ActiveHash models as the parents of polymorphic belongs_to associations
  - save, save!, create and create! now add items to the in-memory collection, and naively adds autoincrementing id
  - new_record? returns false if the record is part of the collection
  - ActiveHash now works with Fixjour!

2009-08-19
  - Added custom finders for multiple fields, such as .find_all_by_name_and_age

2009-07-23
  - Added support for auto-defining methods based on hash keys in ActiveHash::Base
  - Changed the :field and :fields API so that they don't overwrite existing methods (useful when ActiveHash auto-defines methods)
  - Fixed a bug where ActiveFile incorrectly set the root_path to be the path in the gem directory, not the current working directory

2009-07-24
  - ActiveFile no longer reloads files by default
  - Added ActiveFile.reload_active_file= so you can cause ActiveFile to reload
  - Setting data to nil correctly causes .all to return an empty array
  - Added reload(force) method, so that you can force a reload from files in ActiveFile, useful for tests
